defmodule HelloWorld do
  def hello(name) do

    "Your implementation goes here"
    # Elixir counts the number of arguments as part of the function name.
    # For instance,

      #def hello() do
      #end

    # would be a completely different function from

      #def hello(name) do
      #end

    # Can you find a way to make all the tests pass with just one function?
    # Hint: look into argument defaults here:
    # http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/modules.html#default-arguments
