# About

Each Elixir process has its own unique identifier - a _PID_ (process identifier).

- PIDs are their own data type.
  - You can check if a variable is a PID with [`is_pid/1`][kernel-is-pid]
- You can get the current process's PID with `self()`.
- PIDs function as _mailbox addresses_ - if you have a process's PID, you can send a message to that process.
- PIDs are usually created indirectly, as a return value of functions that create new processes, like `spawn`.
  - PIDs should not be created directly by the programmer. If it were required, Erlang has a [`list_to_pid/1`][erlang-list-to-pid] function.
