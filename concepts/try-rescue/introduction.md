Elixir provides a construct for rescuing from errors using `try .. rescue`

```elixir
try do                             #1
  raise RuntimeError, "error"      #2
rescue
  e in RuntimeError -> :error      #3
end
```

Let's examine this construct:

- **Line 1**, the block is declared with `try`.
- **Line 2**, the function call which may error is placed here, in this case we are calling `raise/2`.
- **Line 3**, in the `rescue` section, we pattern match on the _Module_ name of the error raised
  - on the left side of `->`:
    - `e` is matched to the error struct.
    - `in` is a keyword in this occurrence.
    - `RuntimeError` is the error that we want to rescue. If we wanted to rescue from all errors, we could use `_`.
  - on the right side:
    - the instructions to be executed if the error matches.
