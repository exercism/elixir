# About

Elixir represents true and false values with the boolean type. There are only two values: `true` and `false`. These values can be combined with boolean operators ([`and/2`][strict-and], [`or/2`][strict-or], [`not/1`][strict-not]):

```elixir
true_variable = true and true
false_variable = true and false

true_variable = false or true
false_variable = false or false

true_variable = not false
false_variable = not true
```

The operators [`and/2`][strict-and], [`or/2`][strict-or], and [`not/1`][strict-not] are strictly boolean which means they require their _first_ argument to be a boolean. There are also equivalent boolean operators that work any type of arguments - [`&&/2`][and], [`||/2`][or], and [`!/1`][not].

Boolean operators use _short-circuit evaluation_, which means that the expression on the right-hand side of the operator is only evaluated if needed.

Each of the operators has a different precedence, where `not/1` is evaluated before `and/2` and `or/2`. Brackets can be used to evaluate one part of the expression before the others:

```elixir
not true and false
# => false

not (true and false)
# => true
```

When writing a function that returns a boolean value, it is [idiomatic to end the function name][naming] with a `?`. The same convention can be used for variables that store boolean values.

```elixir
def either_true?(a?, b?) do
  a? or b?
end
```
