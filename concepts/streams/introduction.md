# Introduction

All functions in the `Enum` module are _eager_. When performing multiple operations on enumerables with the `Enum` module, each operation is going to generate an intermediate result.

The `Stream` module is a _lazy_ alternative to the _eager_ `Enum` module. It offers many of the same functions as `Enum`, but instead of generating intermediate results, it builds a series of computations that are only executed once the stream is passed to a function from the `Enum` module.

Streams implement the _Enumerable protocol_ and are composable.
