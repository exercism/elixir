# About

[Ranges][range] represent a sequence of one or many consecutive integers. They:

- Are created using the [`..` operator][range-operator] and can be both ascending or descending.
- Their default step is `1`, but can be modified using the [`..//` operator][range-operator-with-step] (since Elixir 1.12).
- Are inclusive of the first and last values.
- Implement the [_Enumerable protocol_][enumerable].
- Are represented internally as a struct, but can be pattern matched using `..`.
- Can be used with integers written in the binary, octal, hexadecimal, and code point notation.
- Can be turned into lists with functions such as [`Enum.to_list/1`][enum-to-list] or [`Enum.map/2`][enum-map].

```elixir
Enum.to_list(9..1)
# => [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Enum.map(?A..?F, &<<&1>>)
["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"]
```
