# Introduction

[Nil][nil-dictionary] is an English word meaning "nothing" or "zero". In Elixir, `nil` is a special value that means an _absence_ of a value.

```elixir
# I do not have a favorite color
favorite_color = nil
```

In other programming languages, `null` or `none` values might play a similar role.
