# This file is automatically generated by concatenating two files:
#
# 1. The Exercism-wide labels: defined in https://github.com/exercism/org-wide-files/blob/main/global-files/.github/labels.yml
# 2. The repository-specific labels: defined in the `.appends/.github/labels.yml` file within this repository.
#
# If any of these two files change, a pull request is automatically containing a re-generated version of this file.
# Consequently, to change repository-specific labels you should update the `.appends/.github/labels.yml` file and _not_ this file.
#
# When the pull request has been merged, the GitHub labels will be automatically updated by the "Sync labels" workflow.
# This typically takes 5-10 minutes.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# These are the Exercism-wide labels which are shared across all repos. #
