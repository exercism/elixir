# Installation

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions can be found at [elixir-lang.org/install](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

For best learning experience on Exercism, we recommend installing locally the same language versions as are used to run tests on your exercise submissions.
Those versions are **Erlang/OTP 26 and Elixir 1.15**.

To check which versions are installed, run `elixir --version` in your command line.
