# Learning

We recommend learning Elixir by working through the syllabus and learning exercises on Exercism.
They were designed to teach you Elixir from scratch.

The official [Elixir Getting Started Guide](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) is also an excellent place to start.
