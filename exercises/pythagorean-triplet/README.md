# Pythagorean Triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for
which,

```
a**2 + b**2 = c**2
```

For example, 

```
3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
```

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.

Find the product a * b * c.

## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)

### Pending tests

In the test suites, all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
commenting out the relevant `@tag :pending` with a `#` symbol.

For example:

```elixir
# @tag :pending
test "shouting" do
  assert Bob.hey("WATCH OUT!") == "Whoa, chill out!"
end
```

Or, you can enable all the tests by commenting out the
`ExUnit.configure` line in the test suite.

```elixir
# ExUnit.configure exclude: :pending, trace: true
```
