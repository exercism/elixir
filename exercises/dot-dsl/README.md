# Dot Dsl

Write a Domain Specific Language similar to the Graphviz dot language.

A [Domain Specific Language
(DSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) is a
small language optimized for a specific domain.

For example the dot language of [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org) allows
you to write a textual description of a graph which is then transformed
into a picture by one of the graphviz tools (such as `dot`). A simple
graph looks like this:

    graph {
        graph [bgcolor="yellow"]
        a [color="red"]
        b [color="blue"]
        a -- b [color="green"]
    }

Putting this in a file `example.dot` and running `dot example.dot -T png
-o example.png` creates an image `example.png` with red and blue circle
connected by a green line on a yellow background.

Create a DSL similar to the dot language.

## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)

### Pending tests

In the test suites, all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
commenting out the relevant `@tag :pending` with a `#` symbol.

For example:

```elixir
# @tag :pending
test "shouting" do
  assert Bob.hey("WATCH OUT!") == "Whoa, chill out!"
end
```

Or, you can enable all the tests by commenting out the
`ExUnit.configure` line in the test suite.

```elixir
# ExUnit.configure exclude: :pending, trace: true
```
