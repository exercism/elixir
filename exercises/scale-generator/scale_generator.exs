  The chromatic scale is a musical scale with thirteen pitches, each a semitone
  (half-tone) above or below another.

  Notes with a sharp (#) are a semitone higher than the note below them, where
  the next letter note is a full tone except in the case of B and E, which have
  no sharps.

  Generate these notes, starting with the given `tonic` and wrapping back
  around to the note before it, ending with the tonic an octave higher than the
  original. If the `tonic` is lowercase, capitalize it.

  Certain scales will require the use of the flat version, depending on the
  `tonic` (key) that begins them, which is C in the above examples.

  For any of the following tonics, use the flat chromatic scale:

  F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb d g c f bb eb

  For all others, use the regular chromatic scale.

  The `pattern` string will let you know how many steps to make for the next
  note in the scale.

  For example, a C Major scale will receive the pattern "MMmMMMm", which
  indicates you will start with C, make a full step over C# to D, another over
  D# to E, then a semitone, stepping from E to F (again, E has no sharp). You
  can follow the rest of the pattern to get:
