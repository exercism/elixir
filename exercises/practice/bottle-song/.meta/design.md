# Design Decisions

## Wording

Since the "verse" term used in the canonical specifications is quite ambiguous, it has been replaced by:
- "line" for a single metrical line in a poem
- "stanza" for a group of lines in a poem
- "poem" form the poem itself

Since this exercise uses only stanzas of 4 lines, it could be replaced by "quatrain".
"Couplet" could be used for pairs of rhyming lines.
