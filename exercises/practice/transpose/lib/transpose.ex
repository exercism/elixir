defmodule Transpose do
  @doc """
  Given an input text, output it transposed.

  Rows become columns and columns become rows. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose.

  If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:
    * Pad to the left with spaces.
    * Don't pad to the right.

  ## Examples

    iex> Transpose.transpose("ABC\\nDE")
    "AD\\nBE\\nC"

    iex> Transpose.transpose("AB\\nDEF")
    "AD\\nBE\\n F"
