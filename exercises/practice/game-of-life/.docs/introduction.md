# Introduction

[Conway's Game of Life][game-of-life] is a fascinating cellular automaton created by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The game consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells that can either be "alive" or "dead."

After each generation, the cells interact with their eight neighbors via a set of rules, which define the new generation.
