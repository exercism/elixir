At first it feels like just another friendly match: cards slapped down, laughter across the table, the occasional victorious grin from Nonna.
But as the game stretches on, something strange happens.
The same cards keep cycling back.
You play card after card, yet the end never seems to come.

You start to wonder.

Suddenly, you're hooked.
What began as a casual game has turned into a quest: _how long can such a game really last?_
_Can you find a sequence even longer than the one you played at the kitchen table?_
_Perhaps even long enough to set a new world record?_
