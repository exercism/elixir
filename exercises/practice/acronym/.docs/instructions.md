# Instructions

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

Punctuation is ignored in two different ways, with the apostrophe in contractions and other stray symbols being dropped, but with hyphens still respected as splitting a word in two.

For example:

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|As Soon As Possible|ASAP|
|Liquid-crystal display|LCD|
|Thank George It's Friday!|TGIF|
