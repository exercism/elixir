# Meetup

Calculate the date of meetups.

Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.  In this exercise, you will take
a description of a meetup date, and return the actual meetup date.

Examples of general descriptions are:

- the first Monday of January 2017
- the third Tuesday of January 2017
- the Wednesteenth of January 2017
- the last Thursday of January 2017

Note that "Monteenth", "Tuesteenth", etc are all made up words. There
was a meetup whose members realized that there are exactly 7 numbered days in a month that
end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week
(Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth'
in every month.

Given examples of a meetup dates, each containing a month, day, year, and descriptor 
(first, second, teenth, etc), calculate the date of the actual meetup.
For example, if given "First Monday of January 2017", the correct meetup date is 2017/1/2
 

## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)

### Pending tests

In the test suites, all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
commenting out the relevant `@tag :pending` with a `#` symbol.

For example:

```elixir
# @tag :pending
test "shouting" do
  assert Bob.hey("WATCH OUT!") == "Whoa, chill out!"
end
```

Or, you can enable all the tests by commenting out the
`ExUnit.configure` line in the test suite.

```elixir
# ExUnit.configure exclude: :pending, trace: true
```
