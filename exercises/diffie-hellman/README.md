# Diffie Hellman

Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to share secrets.  They
start with prime numbers, pick private keys, generate and share public
keys, and then generate a shared secret key.

## Step 0

The test program supplies prime numbers p and g.

## Step 1

Alice picks a private key, a, greater than 1 and less than p.  Bob does
the same to pick a private key b.

## Step 2

Alice calculates a public key A.

    A = g**a mod p

Using the same p and g, Bob similarly calculates a public key B from his
private key b.

## Step 3

Alice and Bob exchange public keys.  Alice calculates secret key s.

    s = B**a mod p

Bob calculates

    s = A**b mod p

The calculations produce the same result!  Alice and Bob now share
secret s.

For generating random numbers, Erlang's `:rand.uniform` or `Enum.random` are
good places to start.

`:math.pow |> round` can be used to find the power of a number, and `rem` for
the modulus.

Neither of those works particularly well (or quickly) for very large integers.
Cryptography generally makes use of numbers larger than 1024 bits. Erlang's
:crypto module has a useful function for finding the modulus of a power,
particularly for enormous integers, but you might need :binary to decode it.


## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ mix test
```

### Pending tests

In the test suites, all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
commenting out the relevant `@tag :pending` with a `#` symbol.

For example:

```elixir
# @tag :pending
test "shouting" do
  assert Bob.hey("WATCH OUT!") == "Whoa, chill out!"
end
```

Or, you can enable all the tests by commenting out the
`ExUnit.configure` line in the test suite.

```elixir
# ExUnit.configure exclude: :pending, trace: true
```
