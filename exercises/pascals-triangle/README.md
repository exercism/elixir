# Pascals Triangle

Compute Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

In Pascal's Triangle each number is computed by adding the numbers to
the right and left of the current position in the previous row.

```plain
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
# ... etc
```

## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)

### Pending tests

In the test suites, all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
commenting out the relevant `@tag :pending` with a `#` symbol.

For example:

```elixir
# @tag :pending
test "shouting" do
  assert Bob.hey("WATCH OUT!") == "Whoa, chill out!"
end
```

Or, you can enable all the tests by commenting out the
`ExUnit.configure` line in the test suite.

```elixir
# ExUnit.configure exclude: :pending, trace: true
```
