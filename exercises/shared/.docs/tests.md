# Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ mix test
```

## Pending tests

In the test suites, all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by commenting out the relevant `@tag :pending` with a `#` symbol.

For example:

```elixir
# @tag :pending
test "shouting" do
  assert Bob.hey("WATCH OUT!") == "Whoa, chill out!"
end
```

If you wish to run all tests at once, you can include all skipped test by using the `--include` flag on the `mix test` command:

```bash
$ mix test --include pending
```

Or, you can enable all the tests by commenting out the `ExUnit.configure` line in the file `test/test_helper.exs`.

```elixir
# ExUnit.configure(exclude: :pending, trace: true)
```
