# Help

If you're stuck on something, it may help to look at some of the [available resources](https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/elixir/resources) out there where answers might be found.
If you can't find what you're looking for in the documentation, feel free to ask help in the Exercism's BEAM [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/exercism/xerlang).
