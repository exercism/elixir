defmodule Transpose do

  Given an input text, output it transposed.

  Rows become columns and columns become rows. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose.

  If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:
    * Pad to the left with spaces.
    * Don't pad to the right.

  ## Examples
  iex> Transpose.transpose("ABC\nDE")
  "AD\nBE\nC"

  iex> Transpose.transpose("AB\nDEF")
  "AD\nBE\n F"
