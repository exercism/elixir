## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach how to use nil values for when nothing exists as a value.

## Learning objectives

- Know what `nil` represents
- Know that `nil` is a special atom
- Know how to pattern match on `nil`
- Know how to use the `if`/`unless` macros
- Know about truthiness

## Out of scope

## Concepts

- `nil`
- `if-conditional`

## Prerequisites

- `strings`
- `booleans` - not strictly necessary for solving the exercise, but necessary for talking about `if`

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

- Check that at least one `if` macro was used to solve the exercise.
