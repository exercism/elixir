## General

- Read about protocols in the [official Getting Started guide][getting-started-protocols] or on [elixirschool.com][elixir-school-enum].

## 1. Define edibility

- There is a [special macro][kernel-defprotocol] for defining protocols.
- Protocols consist of one or more function headers.
- A function header is like a function definition, but without the `do` block. It defines the function name and its arguments, but not what it does.

## 2. Make loaves of bread edible

- There is a [special macro][kernel-defimpl] for implementing a protocol for a given data type.
- Implementing a protocol means writing a function definition for each function header from the protocol.

## 3. Make mana potions edible

- There is a [special macro][kernel-defimpl] for implementing a protocol for a given data type.
- Implementing a protocol means writing a function definition for each function header from the protocol.

## 4. Make poisons edible

- There is a [special macro][kernel-defimpl] for implementing a protocol for a given data type.
- Implementing a protocol means writing a function definition for each function header from the protocol.
