# Design

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, the student should:

- Know of the existence of the `cond/1` control flow structure and how to use it.
- Know how to perform boolean logic using the `===/2` operator function.
- Know how to return values from a function with conditional logic.
- Know of the existence of the [atom][atom] type

## Out of scope

- Pattern matching.
- Function overloading.
- `case` flow control structures.
- Conversion of string to atoms.

## Concepts

- `cond`: know of the existence of the `cond` control flow structure; know how to use boolean expressions to control flow;
- `atoms`: know how to use `atom` values.

## Prerequisites

- `booleans`: be able to work with boolean values, boolean expressions
