# Hints

## General

- The [atom type is described here][atom].

## 1. Determine the log label

- You can use the [`cond/1` special form][cond] to elegantly handle the various log codes.
- You can use [equality operators][equality] to compare integers for strict type equality.
- There is a [way to specify a default branch][cond] in a cond expression that can be used to catch unspecified cases.

## 2. Send an alert

- You can use the [`cond/1` special form][cond] to decide if an alert should be sent.
- You can use [equality operators][equality] to compare atoms for equality.
