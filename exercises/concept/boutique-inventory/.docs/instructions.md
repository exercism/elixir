# Instructions

You are running an online fashion boutique. Your big annual sale is coming up, so you need to take stock of your inventory to make sure you're ready.

A single item in the inventory is represented by a map, and the whole inventory is a list of such maps.

```elixir
%{
  name: "White Shirt",
  price: 40,
  quantity_by_size: %{s: 3, m: 7, l: 8, xl: 4}
}
```

## 1. Sort items by price

Implement the `sort_by_price/1` function. It should take the inventory and return it sorted by item price, ascending.

```elixir
BoutiqueInventory.sort_by_price([
  %{price: 65, name: "Maxi Brown Dress", quantity_by_size: %{}},
  %{price: 50, name: "Red Short Skirt", quantity_by_size: %{}},
  %{price: 50, name: "Black Short Skirt", quantity_by_size: %{}},
  %{price: 20, name: "Bamboo Socks Cats", quantity_by_size: %{}}
])

# => [
#      %{price: 20, name: "Bamboo Socks Cats", quantity_by_size: %{}},
#      %{price: 50, name: "Red Short Skirt", quantity_by_size: %{}},
#      %{price: 50, name: "Black Short Skirt", quantity_by_size: %{}},
#      %{price: 65, name: "Maxi Brown Dress", price: 65, quantity_by_size: %{}}
#    ]
```

## 2. Find all items with missing prices

After sorting your inventory by price, you noticed that you must have made a mistake when you were taking stock and forgot to fill out prices for a few items.

Implement the `with_missing_price/1` function. It should take the inventory and return a list of items that do not have prices.

```elixir
BoutiqueInventory.with_missing_price([
  %{price: 40, name: "Black T-shirt", quantity_by_size: %{}},
  %{price: nil, name: "Denim Pants", quantity_by_size: %{}},
  %{price: nil, name: "Denim Skirt", quantity_by_size: %{}},
  %{price: 40, name: "Orange T-shirt", quantity_by_size: %{}}
])

# => [
#      %{price: nil, name: "Denim Pants", quantity_by_size: %{}},
#      %{price: nil, name: "Denim Skirt", quantity_by_size: %{}}
#    ]
```

## 3. Update item names

You noticed that some item names have a word that you don't like to use anymore. Now you need to update all the item names with that word.

Implement the `update_names/3` function. It should take the inventory, the old word that you want to remove, and a new word that you want to use instead. It should return a list of items with updated names.

```elixir
BoutiqueInventory.update_names(
  [
    %{price: 40, name: "Black T-shirt", quantity_by_size: %{}},
    %{price: 70, name: "Denim Pants", quantity_by_size: %{}},
    %{price: 65, name: "Denim Skirt", quantity_by_size: %{}},
    %{price: 40, name: "Orange T-shirt", quantity_by_size: %{}}
  ],
  "T-shirt",
  "Tee"
)

# => [
#      %{price: 40, name: "Black Tee", quantity_by_size: %{}},
#      %{price: 70, name: "Denim Pants", quantity_by_size: %{}},
#      %{price: 65, name: "Denim Skirt", quantity_by_size: %{}},
#      %{price: 40, name: "Orange Tee", quantity_by_size: %{}}
#    ]
```


## 4. Increment the item's quantity

Some items were selling especially well, so you ordered more, in all sizes.

Implement the `increase_quantity/2` function. It should take a single item and a number `n`, and return that item with the quantity for each size increased by `n`.

```elixir
BoutiqueInventory.increase_quantity(
  %{
    name: "Polka Dot Skirt",
    price: 68,
    quantity_by_size: %{s: 3, m: 5, l: 3, xl: 4}
  },
  6
)

# => %{
#      name: "Polka Dot Skirt",
#      price: 68,
#      quantity_by_size: %{l: 9, m: 11, s: 9, xl: 10}
#    }
```

## 5. Calculate the item's total quantity

To know how much space you need in your storage, you need to know how many of each item you have in total.

Implement the `total_quantity/1` function. It should take a single item and return how many pieces you have in total, in any size.

```elixir
BoutiqueInventory.total_quantity(%{
  name: "Red Shirt",
  price: 62,
  quantity_by_size: %{s: 3, m: 6, l: 5, xl: 2}
})

# => 16
```
