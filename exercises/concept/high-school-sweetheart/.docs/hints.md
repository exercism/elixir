# Hints

## General

- Read about strings in the official [Getting Started guide][getting-started-strings].
- Browse the [functions available in the _String module_][string-module-functions] to discover which operations on strings Elixir's standard library offers.

## 1. Get the name's first letter

- There is a [built-in function][string-first] to get the first character from a string.
- There are multiple [built-in functions][string-trim] to remove leading, trailing, or leading and trailing whitespaces from a string.

## 2. Format the first letter as an initial

- There is a [built-in function][string-upcase] to convert all characters in a string to their uppercase variant.
- There is an [operator][kernel-concat] that concatenates two strings.

## 3. Split the full name into the first name and the last name

- There is a [built-in function][string-split] that splits a string on whitespace characters.
- A few first elements of a list can be assigned to variables by pattern matching on the list.

## 4. Put the initials inside of the heart

- There is a special syntax for [interpolating][string-interpolation] an expression inside of a string.
- There is a special syntax for writing [multiline strings][heredoc-syntax] without needing to escape newlines.
