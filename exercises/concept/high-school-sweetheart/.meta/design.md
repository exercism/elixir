# Design

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, the student should:

- Know how to concatenate strings.
- Know how to manipulate strings.
- Know how to perform string interpolation.
- Know how to create multiline strings (heredocs).
- Know about the `|>` pipe operator for chaining function calls.

## Out of scope

- Strings as binaries for binary pattern matching.
- Regular expressions.
- Sigils.
- Charlists.
- Graphemes and the difference between `byte_size` and `String.length`.

## Prerequisites

- `lists`: needs to be able to work with the return value of `String.split`.
- `pattern-matching`: needs to be able to work with the return value of `String.split`.

## Concepts

- `strings`: knows how to concatenate strings, interpolate expressions inside of strings, create multiline strings, and modify strings using the _String module_.
- `pipe-operator`

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the the [analyzer][analyzer]:

- Verify that the `initial/1` function calls the `first_letter/1` function.
- Verify that the `initials/1` function calls the `initial/1` function.
- Verify that the `pair/1` function calls the `initials/1` function.
