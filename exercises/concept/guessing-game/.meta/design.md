# Design

## Learning objectives

A student upon completion will:

- Know what a guard is.
- Know how to use a guard.
- Know that guards return strict boolean values.
- Know that guards meet certain guarantees to not mutate state.
- Know that guards must be declared in a special form, and not all functions that return boolean values are guards.
- Know how to write basic multiple-clause functions.
- Know how to use guards to protect execution of a function.
- Know how to use guards to perform basic control flow.
- Know how to specify a default argument
- Know that by specifying a default argument, it defines multiple arities for the function name

## Out of scope

- pattern matching

## Concepts
