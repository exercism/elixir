# Instructions

You are creating a trivial online game where a friend can guess a secret number. You want to give some feedback, but not give away the answer with a guess. You need to devise a function to provide different responses depending on how the guess relates to the secret number.

| Condition                                                     | Response       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| When the guess matches the secret number                      | "Correct"      |
| When the guess is one more or one less than the secret number | "So close"     |
| When the guess is greater than the secret number              | "Too high"     |
| When the guess is less than the secret number                 | "Too low"      |
| When a guess isn't made                                       | "Make a guess" |

All guesses and secret numbers are integer numbers.

## 1. Make the response when the guess matches the secret number

Implement the `compare/2` function which takes two arguments, `secret_number` and `guess`, which are both integers.

```elixir
GuessingGame.compare(5, 5)
# => "Correct"
```

## 2. Make the response when the guess is greater than the secret number

Modify the `compare` function to respond to guesses that are higher than the secret number.

```elixir
GuessingGame.compare(5, 8)
# => "Too high"
```

## 3. Make the response when the guess is less than the secret number

Modify the `compare` function to respond to guesses that are lower than the secret number.

```elixir
GuessingGame.compare(5, 2)
# => "Too low"
```

## 4. Make the responses when the guess is one more or one less than the secret number

Modify the `compare` function to respond to guesses that are close to the secret number.

```elixir
GuessingGame.compare(5, 6)
# => "So close"
GuessingGame.compare(5, 4)
# => "So close"
```

## 5. Make the response when there is no guess

Modify the `compare` function to respond to a lack of guess.

```elixir
GuessingGame.compare(5)
# => "Make a guess"

GuessingGame.compare(5, :no_guess)
# => "Make a guess"
```
