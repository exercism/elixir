# Hints

## General

- Read about enumerables and streams in the [official Getting Started guide][getting-started-streams].
- Read the official documentation for [streams][stream].

## 1. Do one 6-sided die roll

- Ranges implement the _Enumerable protocol_.
- There is a [built-in function][enum-random] for choosing a random value from an enumerable.

## 2. Keep rolling as long as you roll sixes

- There is a [built-in function][stream-repeatedly] that creates a stream generated by calling a function repeatedly.
- There is a [built-in function for streams][stream-transform] that works similarly to `Enum.reduce/3`.

## 3. Allow using a rigged die

- Use the [capture operator][special-forms-capture] to capture the `roll/0` function.
