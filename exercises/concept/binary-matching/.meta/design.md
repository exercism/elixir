- Know that strings are a form of encoded binary data
- Know what the `<<>>` special form is
- Know that each value refers to a byte
- Know that can modify the size of a value in a `<<>>` form using `::`
- Know how to pattern match on binary data
- Know how to use hexadecimal literals

## Out of scope

## Prerequisites

- `bitstrings` (TODO)
- `pattern-matching`
- `strings`
- `if`

## Concepts
