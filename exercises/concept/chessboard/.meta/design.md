# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know about ranges.
  - They are structs.
  - They are enumerable.
  - How to transform them to a list.
  - How to generate a list of letters from a range.

## Out of scope

## Prerequisites

- `integers`
- `enum`
- `bitstrings`
- `charlists`

## Concepts

- `ranges`

## Analyzer

- make sure that `ranks` uses `rank_range`
- make sure that `files` uses `file_range`
- make sure that `files` uses `<<>>` to turn a code point into a string
