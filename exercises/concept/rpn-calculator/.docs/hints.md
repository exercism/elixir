# Hints

## General

- Read about [errors][errors] in the Getting Started guide.
- Read about [`try`][docs-try] in the documentation.

## 1. Warn the team

- Allow the operation function to raise its error.
- To invoke a function in a variable, use the `.` operator.

## 2. Wrap the error

- Make use of try .. rescue to return the intended result.

## 3. Pass on the message

- Make use of try .. rescue to return the intended result.
- The rescue block allows you to pattern match on the error's Module name and also bind the error to a variable.
