# Hints

## General

- Read about `if` in the official [Getting Started guide][getting-started-if-unless] or on [elixirschool.com][elixirschool-if-unless].

## 1. Print a badge for an employee

- This is a base case where we can assume that none of the input data is `nil`.
- If you need to refresh your memory about working with strings, read about them in the official [Getting Started guide][getting-started-basic-strings].

## 2. Print a badge for a new employee

- Strings are always _truthy_ and `nil` is _falsy_.
- There is a [macro][kernel-if] that returns one of the two options, depending of whether it was given a _truthy_ or a _falsy_ value.

## 3. Print a badge for the owner

- Strings are always _truthy_ and `nil` is _falsy_.
- There is a [macro][kernel-if] that returns one of the two options, depending of whether it was given a _truthy_ or a _falsy_ value.
