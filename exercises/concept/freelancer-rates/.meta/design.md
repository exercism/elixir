# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how to write floating point literals.
- Know their underlying type (double precision).
- Know their basic limitations (not all numbers can be represented, e.g. `0.1 + 0.2`).
- Know how to truncate floating point numbers to a certain decimal place (`Float.ceil`, `Float.floor`, `Float.round`)
- Know how to convert floats to integers.

## Out of scope

- Parsing integers and floats from strings.
- Converting integers and floats to strings.

## Concepts

- `integers`
- `floating-point-numbers`

## Prerequisites

- `basics`

## Analyzer

- assert that `monthly_rate` calls `apply_discount/2`
- assert that `days_in_budget` calls `apply_discount/2`
