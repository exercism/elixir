# Hints

## General

- Read about basic arithmetic in the official [Getting Started guide][getting-started-basic-arithmetic].
- Browse the [`Float`][float-functions] and [`Kernel`][kernel-arithmetic-operators] modules to learn about functions and operators that work with floats.

## 1. Calculate the daily rate given an hourly rate

- [Basic arithmetic operations][kernel-arithmetic-operators] where one argument is an integer, and the other is a float, will return a float.

## 2. Calculate a discounted price

- [Basic arithmetic operations][kernel-arithmetic-operators] where one argument is an integer, and the other is a float, will return a float.

## 3. Calculate the monthly rate, given an hourly rate and a discount

- There is a [built-in function][kernel-trunc] for changing floats to integers.
- There is a [built-in function][float-ceil] for rounding floats up.

## 4. Calculate the number of workdays given a budget, hourly rate and discount

- There is a [built-in function][float-floor] for rounding floats down with desired precision.
