# Introduction

## Integers

There are two different kinds of numbers in Elixir - integers and floats.

Integers are whole numbers.

```elixir
integer = 3
# => 3
```

## Floating Point Numbers

Floats are numbers with one or more digits behind the decimal separator. They use the 64-bit double precision floating-point format.

```elixir
float = 3.45
# => 3.45
```

### Working with numbers

In the [`Integer`][integer-functions] and [`Float`][float-functions] modules you can find some useful functions for working with those types. Basic arithmetic operators are defined in the [`Kernel`][kernel-arithmetic-operators] module.

### Conversion

Integers and floats can be mixed together in a single arithmetic expression. Using a float in an expression ensures the result will be a float too.

```elixir
2 * 3
# => 6

2 * 3.0
# => 6.0
```

However, when doing division, the result will always be a float, even if only integers are used.

```elixir
6 / 2
# => 3.0
```

To convert a float to an integer, you can discard the decimal part with [`trunc/1`][trunc-1].
