The basic Take-A-Number machine was selling really well, but some users were complaining about its lack of advanced features compared to other models available on the market.

The manufacturer listened to user feedback and decided to release a deluxe model with more features, and you once again were tasked with writing the software for this machine.

The new features added to the deluxe model include:
- Keeping track of currently queued numbers.
- Setting the minimum and maximum number. This will allow using multiple deluxe Take-A-Number machines for queueing customers to different departments at the same facility, and  to tell apart the departments by the number range.
- Allowing certain numbers to skip the queue to provide priority service to pregnant women and the elderly.
