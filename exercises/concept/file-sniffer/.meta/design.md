# Design

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, the student should:

- Know what binary data is
- Know that strings are a form of encoded binary data
- Know what the `<<>>` special form is
- Know that each value refers to a byte
- Know that can modify the size of a value in a `<<>>` form using `::`
- Know how to pattern match on binary data
- Know how to use hexadecimal literals

## Out of scope

- Recursion on matched binaries

## Prerequisites

- `bitstrings`
- `pattern-matching`
- `strings`
- `if`

## Concepts

- `binaries`

## Analyzer

- Rules for ensuring pattern matching is being done with the binary data
