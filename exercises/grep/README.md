# Grep

Search a file for lines matching a regular expression pattern. Return the line
number and contents of each matching line.

The Unix [`grep`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html) command can be used to search for lines in one or more files 
that match a user-provided search query (known as the *pattern*).

The `grep` command takes three arguments:

1. The pattern used to match lines in a file. 
2. Zero or more flags to customize the matching behavior.
3. One or more files in which to search for matching lines. 

Your task is to implement the `grep` function, which should read the contents
of the specified files, find the lines that match the specified pattern
and then output those lines as a single string. Note that the lines should
be output in the order in which they were found, with the first matching line
in the first file being output first.

As an example, suppose there is a file named "input.txt" with the following contents:

<pre>
hello
world
hello again
</pre>

If we were to call `grep "hello" input.txt`, the returned string should be:

<pre>
hello
hello again
</pre>

### Flags

As said earlier, the `grep` command should also support the following flags:

- `-n` Print the line numbers of each matching line.
- `-l` Print only the names of files that contain at least one matching line.
- `-i` Match line using a case-insensitive comparison.
- `-v` Invert the program -- collect all lines that fail to match the pattern.
- `-x` Only match entire lines, instead of lines that contain a match.

If we run `grep -n "hello" input.txt`, the `-n` flag will require the matching
lines to be prefixed with its line number:

<pre>
1:hello
3:hello again
</pre>

And if we run `grep -i "HELLO" input.txt`, we'll do a case-insensitive match, 
and the output will be:

<pre>
hello
hello again
</pre>

The `grep` command should support multiple flags at once.

For example, running `grep -l -v "hello" file1.txt file2.txt` should
print the names of files that do not contain the string "hello".

## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)

### Pending tests

In the test suites, all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
commenting out the relevant `@tag :pending` with a `#` symbol.

For example:

```elixir
# @tag :pending
test "shouting" do
  assert Bob.hey("WATCH OUT!") == "Whoa, chill out!"
end
```

Or, you can enable all the tests by commenting out the
`ExUnit.configure` line in the test suite.

```elixir
# ExUnit.configure exclude: :pending, trace: true
```
